# BallRolling_Game
This is the first game project that I made in my Virtual Reality Game Development class. The game is sort of like "Temple Run". To play this game you must have the Unity application on your windows device. To move you use the "a" and "d" keys to move left and right. The goal of the game is to get the highest score you can by avoiding obstacles.

IF you do not have the software installed, you can watch a video demonstration
